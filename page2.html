  <p>According to <a class="colors" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/opinion/kristof-arsenic-in-our-chicken.html">"Arsenic in Our Chicken?"</a> chickens are fed banned antibiotics, caffeine, and possibly arsenic. Arsenic is known to cause arsenic-poisoning, yet they are fed to chickens to keep them healthy. Also, they may not kill all the harmful bacteria. The  remaining bacteria that can survive will grow and create a superbug!</p>

  <p>The superbug that these chickens create and carry will be passed on through their waste and when they are dead. Humans end up handling their waste and carcasses. Some will end up eating the chickens unknowingly! This means that humans will be infected by the superbug, which will not be cured by the regular antibiotics. </p>

  <p>Antibiotic-resistant infections are not always severe, but they can slowly harm one's well-being, especially if it is unable to be cured. Arsenic poisoning, on the other hand, can cause severe symptoms and death according to the <a class="colors" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic">WHO</a> organization, which should make people wary of what processing has been done. The table below shows the yearly averages of antibiotic-resistant infections compared to the flu in 2019 to help show why antibiotic-resistant infections should not just be ignored.</p>

  <table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Disease</th>
    <th>Infected</th>
    <th>Deaths</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Antibiotic-resistant Infection</td>
    <td>2,800,000</td>
    <td>35,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flu in 2019</td>
    <td>35,500,000</td>
    <td>34,200</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Even though antibiotic-resistant diseases show to be less infectious, more people have died because of them than the flu in 2019. Superbug illnesses may cause numbers to go up, and it could be stopped instead.</p>
