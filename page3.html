  <p>Eating organic foods is a solution to avoid antibiotic-resistant diseases from livestock. It is an easy option, and does not require completely giving up on eating certain foods. Others may disagree about eating organic because organic foods are more expensive. However, chickens and livestock are fed antibiotics because it is cheaper, which is a reason why there are infections that are antibiotic-resistant. Being healthy should be enough reason to spend a little extra.</p>

  <p>Vegetarianism and veganism are valid ways of avoiding this livestock-spread, antibiotic-resistant disease. Though people have to give up some foods, it is considered cheaper and healthier. Some people will say that giving up meat or any products that come from animals is extreme and loses major proteins needed in a healthy diet. Still, there are other foods that provide the necessary proteins, and the lack of meat is not meant for everyone, as there are other solutions.</p>

  <h2 class="center"> The Usual Food Safety Tips </h2>

  <p>The regular food safety precautions can stop any foodborne disease. Tips like washing your hands, separating foods, properly cooking, and keeping food fresh helps keep antibiotic-resistant and all bacteria away. There are some who may argue that the bacteria can still be passed on through eating the infected animal or touching it, but harmful bacteria should not exist if the proper precautions were taken. Washing hands and cooking food properly kills that bacteria. Separation of foods and the use of only fresh foods limits the spread of bacteria even more.</p>
